The file is opened and a pointer is positioned at the beginning of the fileâ€™s content.\n* **`â€˜wâ€™`** â€“ Write Mode: Using this mode will overwrite any existing content in a file. If the given file does not exist, a new one will be created. \n* **`â€˜r+â€™`** â€“ Read/Write Mode: Use this mode if you need to simultaneously read and write to a file.\n* **`â€˜aâ€™`** â€“ Append Mode: With this mode the user can append the data without overwriting any already existing data in the file. \n* **`â€˜a+â€™`** â€“ Append and Read Mode: In this mode you can read and append the data without overwriting the original file.\n* **`â€˜xâ€™`** â€“ Exclusive Creating Mode: This mode is for the sole purpose of creating new files.

You may want to use readline() when you're reading files that are too big for your RAM.\n* The **`read()`** would treat each character in the file separately, meaning that the iteration would happen for every character.\n* The **`readline()`** function, on the other hand, only reads a single line of the file. This means that if the first line of the file were three lines long, the readline() function would only parse (or iterate/operate) on the first line of the file.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 9.What data structure does a shelf value resemble ?\n**Ans:** it contains key and values it represents dictionary.","metadata":{}}]}

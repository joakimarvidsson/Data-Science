PdfFileReader class provides a attribute called **`isEncrypted`** to check whether a pdf is encrypted or not. the method returns true if a pdf is encrypted and vice versa.  \nif pdf is encrypted use the **`decrypt()`** method provided by PdfFileReader class first then try to read the contents/pages of the pdf, else PyPDF2 will raise the following error **`PyPDF2.utils.PdfReadError: file has not been decrypted`**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Example Code:\nfrom PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader\npdf_reader = PdfFileReader(file_path)\nif pdf_reader.isEncrypted: # to check whether the pdf is encrypted or not\n    pdf_reader.decrypt(\"swordfish\")\nfor page in pdf_reader.pages:\n    print(page.extractText()) # to print the text data of a page from pdf","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-10-29T07:08:33.846573Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-10-29T07:08:33.847892Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-10-29T07:08:33.847567Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-10-29T07:08:33.847595Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 5.

What is the difference between a Run object and a Paragraph object?\n**Ans:** The structure of a document is represented by three different data types in **`python-Docx`**. At the highest level, a `Document` object represents the entire document. The Document object contains a list of **`Paragraph`** objects for the paragraphs in the document. (A new paragraph begins whenever the user presses `ENTER` or `RETURN` while typing in a Word document.) Each of these Paragraph objects contains a list of one or more **`Run`** objects.\n\nThe text in a Word document is more than just a string. It has font, size, color, and other styling information associated with it. A style in Word is a collection of these attributes. A Run object is a contiguous run of text with the same style. A new Run object is needed whenever the text style changes.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 7.

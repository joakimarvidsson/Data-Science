Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n**Ans:** \n\n* Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. \n* This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.\n* The main advantage of functions is code Reusability.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n**Ans:** The code in a function executes when the function is called, not when the function is specified.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 3.

How many global scopes are there in a Python program?

How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n**Ans:** A global statement will force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable.\nIf you want to refer to a global variable in a function, you can use the `global` keyword to declare which variables are  global.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 10.
